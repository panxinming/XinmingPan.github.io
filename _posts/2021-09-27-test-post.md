This is my first blog post.

First, I am going to upload our dataset called penguins. I would like to find how
the body mass of these penguins are distributed. So, I plan to create a histogram
so that I can clearly see which interval has the largest frequency.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)

# We are going to create a histogram which represents the body mass of penguins
x = penguins["Body Mass (g)"]
plt.hist(x,edgecolor='black')
plt.title("Histogram of Penguins Body Mass")
plt.xlabel("Body Mass (g)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
``` 
![histogram.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/histogram.png)

From the histogram we got, we can see that the penguins whose weights between
3500 and 4000 grams has the largest amount.
