This is my first blog post.

First, I am going to upload our dataset called penguins.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)

x = penguins["Body Mass (g)"]
plt.hist(x,edgecolor='black')
plt.show()
```
