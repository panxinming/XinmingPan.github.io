title: Variational Inference

Variational inference is a technique for approximating intractable posterior distributions in Bayesian inference. The basic idea is to construct a simpler, tractable distribution (the variational distribution) that approximates the true posterior distribution, and then optimize the parameters of this variational distribution to minimize the difference between the two distributions.

Mathematically, we can write the problem of variational inference as follows. Given observed data $x$ and a prior distribution $p(z)$ over latent variables $z$, we want to compute the posterior distribution $p(z|x)$. However, this posterior is often intractable to compute directly. Instead, we introduce a family of variational distributions $q(z|\theta)$ parameterized by $\theta$, and minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between $q(z|\theta)$ and $p(z|x)$:


$$\min_{\theta} \mathrm{KL}(q(z|\theta) || p(z|x))$$

where

$$\mathrm{KL}(q(z|\theta) || p(z|x)) = \int q(z|\theta) \log \frac{q(z|\theta)}{p(z|x)} dz$$

This optimization problem can be solved using various techniques, such as gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, or variational EM. The resulting variational distribution $q(z|\theta^*)$ can then be used as an approximation to the true posterior distribution $p(z|x)$.

To implement the variational inference algorithm in Python, we need to define the variational distribution $q(z|\theta)$ and the prior distribution $p(z)$, as well as the objective function to minimize. Here's an example implementation using the mean-field variational family, where each latent variable is assumed to be independent and normally distributed:
