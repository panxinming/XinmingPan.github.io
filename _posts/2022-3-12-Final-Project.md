We write this Reflection Blog Post as a group. Our group members are **Xinming Pan** and **Xinyu Dong**.


## Topics
- **Overall, what did you achieve in your project?**

>Our project is about breast cancer prediction. From our project, we learned how to use Python to do machine learning problems. What's more, We learned how to use pandas to do data cleaning, Plotly to do data visualization, and Flask to build WebApp. These are the most valuable thing I learned from PIC 16B and our Project. 
Besides these, we learned every algorithm may has bias, what we need to do is to prevent these bias and reduce them. Make our algorithm more justice.

- **What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of?**

>The **first** part we are proud of is the WebApp we created. Because we don't know how to apply machine learning into WebApp design, but finally we did it! We created a beautiful WebApp and our WebApp can run the code we written. And I think our App is very useful, it can help patients who has potential breast cancer to detect at home or online. The **second** part we are proud of is 


- **What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project? (You are not responsible for doing those things.)** 

>The **first** thing we need to improve is the decoration of our WebApp. Because we learned how to use CSS file to decorate our WebApp, but actually we did not try to do that. Our WebApp is not outstanding, if we want to attract more users, the decoration is necessary.
The **second** thing we want to improve is the bias. As we mention before, our App has some algorithm bias. Because all the data is collected comes from United States. So, if you are the patients who come from Aisa, Africa, Europe etc. The prediction may be incorrect. What we want to improve is to mention these bias before the user use our WebApp, let them know the bias.

- **How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? (if you didn't complete everything in your proposal, that's fine!)**

>We almost done everything what we mentioned in our proposal. However, there are two thing we didn't complete. The first thing is we are going to save the data into database and use SQL command to extract our data initially, but finally we just use Pandas to load our data. The second thing we didn't complete is to use CSS file to decorate our WebApp. Because we learned how to use CSS file to decorate our WebApp, but actually we did not try to do that. Our WebApp is not outstanding, if we want to attract more users, the decoration is necessary.

- **What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project? Data analysis techniques? Python packages? Git + GitHub? Etc?** 

>The three things we learned from the experience of completing our project are the use of Flask package, the use of TensorFlow  and machine learning knowledge.

- **How will your experience completing this project will help you in your future studies or career? Please be as specific as possible.**

> If we meet some intersting or useful knowledge associated with Python, we can write down them in our Blog. Yes, we are planning to use our Blog even though PIC 16B is finished. And WebApp construction is very useful in future career, because we use App every day. Basically, if we want to have a good career, we must build an ability to create WebApp. Now, we learned how to apply database, SQL and machine learning method into WebApp, that helps us to create more useful WebApp in the future.
