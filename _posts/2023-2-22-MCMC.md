title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo
---


**Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods provide powerful and widely applicable algorithms for simulating from probability distributions, including complex and high-dimensional distributions.

It is combined with two parts, **Markov Chain** and **Monte Carlo**.


## 1. Monte Carlo

Monte Carlo is a method that generate random numbers to deal with some problems. One classic method to generate random number is called [Middle-Square Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-square_method)

For example, we can use Monte Carlo Method to estimate the value of $$\pi$$.

## 2. Markov Chain

### Markov Property

In **Stochastic Process**, if one specific time is $$x_n$$, then the probability of $$x_{n+1}$$ is called Markov Property. In probability theory and statistics, the term Markov property refers to the memoryless property of a stochastic process.

In Mathematical Formula, it can be written as:

$$p(X_{n+1}=k|X_n=k_n,X_{n-1}=k_{n-1},...,X_1=k_1)=p(X_{n+1}=k|X_n=k_n)$$

So, if one process has **Stochastic Process**, it can also be called **Markov Process**.
