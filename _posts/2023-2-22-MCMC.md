title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo
---


**Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods provide powerful and widely applicable algorithms for simulating from probability distributions, including complex and high-dimensional distributions.

It is combined with two parts, **Markov Chain** and **Monte Carlo**.


## 1. Monte Carlo

Monte Carlo is a method that generate random numbers to deal with some problems. One classic method to generate random number is called [Middle-Square Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-square_method)

For example, we can use Monte Carlo Method to estimate the value of $$\pi$$.

## 2. Markov Chain

### A. Markov Property

In **Stochastic Process**, if one specific time is $$x_n$$, then the probability of $$x_{n+1}$$ is called Markov Property. In probability theory and statistics, the term Markov property refers to the memoryless property of a stochastic process.

In Mathematical Formula, it can be written as:

$$p(X_{n+1}=k|X_n=k_n,X_{n-1}=k_{n-1},...,X_1=k_1)=p(X_{n+1}=k|X_n=k_n)$$

So, if one process has **Stochastic Process**, it can also be called **Markov Process**.

### B. The Stationary Distribution

For example, you have a [Transition Rate Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_rate_matrix), and you write it as $$Q$$.

For example, we have our $$Q$$ matrix as: $$\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
0.9 & 0.075 & 0.025 \\
0.15 & 0.8 & 0.05 \\
0.25 & 0.25 & 0.5
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}$$

Suppose we have $$3$$ points, then $$Q_{11}$$ means the probability from point A to itself is $$0.9$$.
