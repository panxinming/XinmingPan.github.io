title: Markov Chain Monte Carlo
---


**Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods provide powerful and widely applicable algorithms for simulating from probability distributions, including complex and high-dimensional distributions.

It is combined with two parts, **Markov Chain** and **Monte Carlo**.


## 1. Monte Carlo

Monte Carlo is a method that generate random numbers to deal with some problems. One classic method to generate random number is called [Middle-Square Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-square_method)

For example, we can use Monte Carlo Method to estimate the value of $\pi$.

## 2. Markov Chain
