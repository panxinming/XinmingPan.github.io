## Data Wrangling and Visualization

In this blog post, we’ll create several interesting, interactive data graphics using the NOAA climate data.

## 1. Create a Database

>Because we are going to create a database which is include three tables,
so we should load these three data first. Then, add them into our database.
First we can import some libraries and create an empty database.

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
```
<br />
Load data one by one.

```python
# load temperature data.
temperatures_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
temperatures = temperatures_iter.__next__()
# add temperature into my data base.
for temperatures in temperatures_iter:
    temperatures.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)

# load stations data.
stations = pd.read_csv("station-metadata.csv")
# add stations into my data base
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)

# load countries data.
countries = pd.read_csv("countries.csv")
countries.rename(columns = {"ISO 3166":"ISO_3166", "FIPS 10-4": "FIPS_10-4"})
# add countires into my data base
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```
<br />
Last step, let's check what our database includes.
```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")
print(cursor.fetchall())
```
```
[('temperatures',), ('stations',), ('countries',)]
```
<br />
Looks Right.

## 2. Write a Query Function
>We need to write CMD to extract data from SQL.

```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
        conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
    
        # write cmd first.
        cmd = \
        """
        SELECT S.NAME, S.LATITUDE, S.LONGITUDE, C.Name, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp
        FROM temperatures T
        LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
        LEFT JOIN countries C on SUBSTRING (T.id, 1, 2) = C.`fips 10-4`
        WHERE (T.Year BETWEEN ? AND ?) AND T.Month = ? AND C.Name = ?
        """
        # get our data from SQL.
        df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = (year_begin, year_end,
                                                    month, country))
        df.rename(columns = {"Name": "Country"})
        return df
```
Let's try for the result.

```python
query_climate_database(country = "India", 
                       year_begin = 1980, 
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
```
{% include filename.html %}

<br />
Perfect.

## 3. Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases
```python
from plotly import express as px
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def coef(data_group):
    x = data_group[["Year"]] # 2 brackets because X should be a df
    y = data_group["Temp"]   # 1 bracket because y should be a series
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return round(LR.coef_[0], 4)


color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    df = query_climate_database(country = country, 
                                year_begin = year_begin, 
                                year_end = year_end,
                                month = month)
    # remove those stations whose number of years is smaller than min_obs.    
    df = df[df.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(len) >= min_obs]
    # extract the variable we need, and calculate the yearly increase in temperature.
    df4 = pd.concat([df.groupby(["NAME"])["LATITUDE"].aggregate([np.mean]),
                     df.groupby(["NAME"])["LONGITUDE"].aggregate([np.mean]),
                     pd.DataFrame(df.groupby(["NAME"]).apply(coef))], axis=1)
    # rename these column names.
    column_names = df4.columns.values
    column_names[0] = "LATITUDE"
    column_names[1] = "LONGITUDE"
    column_names[2] = "Estimated yearly increase(℃)"
    df4.columns = column_names
    df4["NAME"] = df4.index
    # create a dictionary so that we can change number into specific month.
    month_dic = {1 : 'January', 2 : 'February', 3 : 'March', 4 : 'April',
                 5 : 'May', 6 : 'June', 7 : 'July', 8 : 'August', 
                 9 : 'September', 10 : 'October', 11 : 'November',
                 12 : 'December'}
    month = month_dic[int(month)]
   # add title to our plot.
    title = "Estimates of yearly increase in temperature in {a} for stations in {b}, years {c} - {d}"\
            .format(a = month, b = country, c = year_begin, d = year_end)
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(df4, 
                        lat = "LATITUDE",
                        lon = "LONGITUDE",
                        hover_name = "NAME",
                        color_continuous_midpoint = 0,
                        color = "Estimated yearly increase(℃)",
                        title = title,
                        **kwargs)
    return fig

```
<br />
Let's try for the result.
```python
fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)
fig.show()
```

 {% include dv1.html %}

## 4. Create Two More Interesting Figures
### (a). Monthly Changes in Temperature in Different Years in Different Regions
```python
def f(name, year1, year2, year3):
    '''
    This function shows multiple facets. The funnction have four
    arguments. The meaning of this function is to plot three different
    figures which can represent how temperature changed by month. 
    '''
    # connect to SQL database.
    conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db") 
    # write our CMD to extract data.
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, T.year, T.month, T.temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    WHERE S.name = ? and T.year = ?
    """
    df1 = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = (name, year1))
    df2 = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = (name, year2))
    df3 = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = (name, year3))
    # combine our data.
    df = pd.concat([df1,df2,df3],axis=0)
    # plot our data.
    fig = px.line(data_frame = df, 
                 x = "Month", 
                 y = "Temp",
                color = "Year",
                facet_col = "Year",
                  title = "Monthly Changes in Temperature in Different Years in " + str(name)
                )
    # show the plot
    return fig

fig = f("BRIANNA",1995,2002,2013)
fig.show()
```

{% include dv2.html %}

From three line charts, we can see that in different years, the Temperature changed by month is different.
BRIANNA has higest temperature in Dec, Jan in 2013. And over the past 10 years, the temperature in Jan is becoming
higher. This is may due to the global warming or industry development. However, the temperature in June or July is
lower and lower over the past 10 years.

<br />

### (b). If STNELEV related to Temperature Between Two Time Periods

<br />

```python
def g(year1, year2):
    '''
    This function have two arguments, every point in the scatter plot represent one station.
    My goal is to compare if the STNELEV related to Temperature between two time periods.
    '''
    # connect to our database.
    conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db") 
    # write our CMD to extract data.
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, T.year, T.month, T.temp, S.STNELEV
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    WHERE T.year = ? or T.year = ?
    """
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = (year1, year2))
    # use groupby to calculate the temperature in two different time period in every station.
    df = pd.DataFrame({"Temp": df.groupby(["NAME","Year"])["Temp"].mean(), "STNELEV": df.groupby(["NAME","Year"])["STNELEV"].mean()})
    df = df.reset_index()
    # change variable "Year" to categorical variable. 
    df['Year'] = df['Year'].astype(object)
    fig = px.scatter(data_frame = df, 
                 x = "Temp", 
                 y = "STNELEV",
                 color = "Year",
                     trendline = "ols",
                facet_col = "Year")
    return fig

fig = g(1995,2005)
fig.show()
```
{% include dv3.html %}

From our plot , we can see that in 1995, the function that can represent STNELEV related to Temperature
is    STNELEV = $$-13.18 \times$$ Temp $$+724$$.

However, in 2005, it changed to STNELEV = $$-18.1 \times$$ Temp $$+784$$.

From above, we can see that, over the past ten years. The relationship between Temperatures and STNELEV changed a lot,
if Temperature is higher, STNELEV will become lower.
