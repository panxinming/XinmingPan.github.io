## 1. Frist Simple Plot

This is my first blog post.

First, I am going to upload our dataset called penguins. I would like to find how
the body mass of these penguins are distributed. So, I plan to create a histogram
so that I can clearly see which interval has the largest frequency.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)

# We are going to create a histogram which represents the body mass of penguins
# I try to select the Body Mass of each penguin.
x = penguins["Body Mass (g)"]
# Draw the histogram.
plt.hist(x,edgecolor='black')
# Give the histogram Title, Label X and Label Y.
plt.title("Histogram of Penguins Body Mass")
plt.xlabel("Body Mass (g)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
```

From the histogram we got, we can see that the penguins whose weights between
3500 and 4000 grams has the largest amount.


## 2. Second Fancy Plot

The second plot I want to plot is the scatter plot. We set X label as flipper and Y label as culmen
and color them base on the species.

```python
#create an empty plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
# Give our empty plot X label, Y label.
ax.set(xlabel = "Culmen Length (mm)",
ylabel = "Flipper Length (mm)")
# See how many species we have and what are they.
species = set(penguins["Species"])
#plot a scattle plot for flipper and culmen
#and color them base on the species
for s in species:
 # There are three species in total, so plot one specie in each loop.
 sub = penguins[penguins["Species"]==s]
 ax.scatter(sub["Culmen Length (mm)"],
 sub["Flipper Length (mm)"],
 label = s.split(" ")[0],
 alpha = 0.5)
plt.legend()
```

![species.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/species.png)

From the scatter plot, we can clearly see how these three species penguin are distributed.
